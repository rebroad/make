= Remove some of that TTY fix code (as probably wasn't needed given the final fix was simple)
= Instead of iterating through ALL of /proc, we should iterate through the reserved array and the decendants array.
= In fact, we could probably combined reserved and decendants into one. Create entres within job.c (and add to reserved_mb), then when we see it in
  monitor_thread, mark it active (by updating peak_mb) and remove it from the reserve_mb total.
